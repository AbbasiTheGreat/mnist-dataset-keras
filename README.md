this notebook is structured to prepare the data for training a neural network model on the MNIST dataset, covering steps from data loading and preprocessing to label encoding. The rest of the notebook likely includes defining the model architecture, compiling the model, and training it
Getting hands-on experience with Machine Learning tools and libraries to gain more insights and experience in the field of ML/AI.
I started working on the course of Practical Deep Learning by Sir Mohammad Nauman , which covers all the concepts of Deep Learning. The first but simple lesson I covered was to train the MNIST dataset using Keras libray which included data preparation techniques like data reshaping and data conversion etc to make the model learn. Afterwards defined a simple neural network and performed training. 
Achieved an accuracy of 0.113 which ultimately was not to the goal , the main purpose was to dive deep into the process and understand the extreme details in the backend.
